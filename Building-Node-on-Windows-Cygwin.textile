h3. Build problems:

h4. C:\Program Files\Python27\python.exe: can't open file '/cygdrive/c/node/tools/waf-light': [Errno 2] No such file or directory

This is not an issue with node. You are using the Windows version of python in Cygwin (and it doesn't know how to process Cygwin style pathnames). You need to remove the Windows version (or make sure is not in the path) and install the Cygwin version of python.

h3. Know issues:

h4. domain name resolution

Cygwin internally uses Windows for DNS queries. Node.js uses the c-ares library that relies on /etc/resolv.conf. Cygwin ships with an empty /etc/resolv.conf. In order to enabled networking add a domain name server to the file:

bc. # add the IP of a valid name server
nameserver 11.22.33.44
