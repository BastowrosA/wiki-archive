This page lists ideas of a *possible* participation in "GSoC2010":http://socghop.appspot.com . Actual list of mentoring organizations selected by Google will be published on 18th March 2010.

h2. Core Node

* Rewrite DNS module - using "c-ares":http://c-ares.haxx.se/ . See "this":http://groups.google.com/group/nodejs/browse_thread/thread/b49eeba96bfd4b4
* Port to windows.
* HTML parser
* <strike>Ability to do text user interfaces (by binding to ncurses)</strike> (a binding now exists for this for node)

h2. Web

* Apache Sling-like REST style web framework.
* A templating framework that abstracts the different languages available into a clean asynchronous wrapper
* In browser MVC framework
* Browser based IDE for node.js using node_debug

h2. Bindings

* Async MySQL bindings - using "MySAC":http://freshmeat.net/projects/mysac

h2. Other

* Thrift/Avro/PB interfaces
* Port "env.js":http://ejohn.org/blog/bringing-the-browser-to-the-server/ to node
** And/or maybe "jsdom":http://github.com/tmpvar/jsdom (-tmpvar: this is already available to node!)
** Abstract "Qt's DOM Parser":http://doc.trolltech.com/4.4/qdomdocument.html for use within Node.js.
*** Maybe a better idea, is to bind libxml2 and a XML serializer
* Add support for UDP to node
* A graphics library, ideally using the same API as html canvas (a solid set of low level bindings to Cairo or AGG or Skia would suffice)
* Implement a well-documented, @require()@able message queue server (using AMQP?)
* Implement a well-documented, @require()@able IRC server
