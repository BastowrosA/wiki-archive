??This is a step-by-step guide on installing Node.js on Windows XP though Portable Ubuntu Remix:??


*1.* Download and unpack "Portable Ubuntu Remix":http://sourceforge.net/projects/portableubuntu/files/portableubuntu/UNO/Portable_Ubuntu.exe/download.

*2.* Open *config/portable_ubuntu.conf* in your favourite text editor and add the following line at the end:

<pre>ports_to_redirect=tcp:8000:8000</pre>

*3.* Double-click *run_portable_ubuntu.bat* to start Portable Ubuntu.

*4.* Open the terminal and type the following line:

<pre>sudo gedit /etc/resolv.conf</pre>

The sudo password by default is: @123456@. Change the nameserver into a working DNS nameserver. I use "Google's Public DNS":http://code.google.com/speed/public-dns/. If you want to use Google's Public DNS replace what you see in resolv.conf with:

<pre>
nameserver 8.8.8.8
nameserver 8.8.4.4
</pre>

*5.* Still inside the terminal type the following (one line at a time):

<pre>
sudo apt-get install g++ git-core libssl-dev curl apache2-utils
echo 'export PATH=$HOME/local/bin:$PATH' >> ~/.bashrc
. ~/.bashrc
mkdir ~/local
mkdir ~/node-latest-install
cd ~/node-latest-install
curl http://nodejs.org/dist/node-latest.tar.gz | tar xz --strip-components=1
./configure --prefix=~/local
make
make install
</pre>

That's all! You now can run node.js by typing in the terminal:

<pre>node <your_app.js></pre>

Open Firefox in Portable Ubuntu and type the url *http://127.0.0.1:8000/* and it should work, provided you have the server listening to *port 8000* (if you want to use another port you need to edit *portable_ubuntu.conf* as described in step *2*). "Here are a few Hello World examples with code":http://howtonode.org/hello-node to get you started quickly, and "here is the list of available modules":http://wiki.github.com/ry/node/modules you can use with node.js to extend its functionality (frameworks, database connection, etc.) ??[Warning: "Not all of them work":http://wiki.github.com/ry/node/library-compatibility with the latest version of node.js]??.

??Extra Tips:?? 

* To share a folder between Windows and Portable Ubuntu edit *portable_ubuntu.conf* and add:
<pre>shared_folder0=C:\your\folder</pre>and you should find it under the */media/* path in Ubuntu (always after restarting having edited the config file)
