h2. Getting your code into Node

The only "official" node repository is https://github.com/joyent/node. For code, docs, tests, or anything else, joyent/node is the repository that reflects the official state of the Node.js project. That's where all patches have to end up if they are going to be in the release, website, or API docs. There are a variety of ways to do this.

# Email patches to ry@tinyclouds.org and post them to the "node.js development mailing list":http://groups.google.com/group/nodejs-dev. Please add "[PATCH]" in the subject
# Send a pull request via github to joyent/node
# Post an issue to the mailing list describing the problem and paste a url to the patch "gist":https://gist.github.com/

To generate patch files:

# clone the "git repository":https://github.com/joyent/node
# make your change. Remember to update tests and docs as well as code!
# commit your change
# Use the <code>git format-patch</code> command to generate patch files.

h2. Some participation guidelines

# C++ code should follow "Google's C++ style guide":http://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/cppguide.xml and be run through cpplint with `make cpplint`.
