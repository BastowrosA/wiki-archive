*Organization Name:*
Node.js Community

*Description:*
Node.js is server side JavaScript runtime build on top of the V8 JavaScript engine. The project aims to simplify the writing of scalable networks programs by using an event loop rather than threads as an abstraction for concurrent operations.

Since the initial release (Feb 16th 2009), the project has:

* Attracted a community of ~1000 users on the mailing list
* Received standing ovations at the JSConf.eu conference (2009)
* Been deployed for comet applications used by millions of users (Plurk)
* Favorably competed in benchmarks with similar technologies (EventMachine, Twisted, Tornado)
* Ported V8 to the Solaris plattform and contributed the work back to Google

*Why is your organization applying to participate in GSoC 2010? What do you hope to gain by participating? (needs long answer)*
By participating in GSoC, we hope to increase node's adoption beyond the early-adopter crowd it has reached so far.


*Did your organization participate in past GSoCs? If so, please summarize your involvement and the successes and challenges of your participation.*
(No previous participation)

*If your organization participated in past GSoCs, please let us know the ratio of students passing to students allocated, e.g. 2006: 3/6 for 3 out of 6 students passed in 2006.*

*What criteria did you use to select the individuals who will act as mentors for your organization? Please be as specific as possible:*
* Reliability: People who have shown their commitment to the project and who can realistically allocate the time necessary.
* C/C++ skils: Most tasks require good knowledge of those languages

*What will you do to ensure that your accepted students stick with the project after GSoC concludes?*
* Getting their contributions deployed in applications used by millions of people
* Following up with them via email / phone
* Providing continued mentoring after the program ends

*Is there anything else you would like to tell the Google Summer of Code program administration team? :*
We think JavaScript is going to be the next big language. If we are not selected, we hope other JavaScript related projects will!
