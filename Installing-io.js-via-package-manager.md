At the moment installing from the package manager is not yet supported. Some package managers already support installing io.js via the package manger but it is unsupported by io.js at the moment.

Support is on its way but since io.js is still a relatively new project the recommended way to install it is [building it](https://github.com/iojs/io.js/wiki/Installing-Building-io.js) or [getting a binary](https://github.com/iojs/io.js/wiki/Installing-Building-io.js#installing-on-linux) directly.

Support in distribution package managers is on its way.
