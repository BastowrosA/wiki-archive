Installing Node.js via package manager is supported by the [nodesource repositories](https://github.com/nodesource/distributions).

See the [installation instructions](https://github.com/nodesource/distributions#installation-instructions).

Many distributions support installing Node.js in their default repositories but these releases may be far out of date.
