At the moment installing from the package manager is not yet supported.

Support is on its way but since io.js is still a relatively new project the recommended way to install it is [building it](https://github.com/iojs/io.js/wiki/Installing-Building-io.js) or [getting a binary](https://github.com/iojs/io.js/wiki/Installing-Building-io.js#installing-on-linux) directly.

Support in distribution package managers is on its way.
