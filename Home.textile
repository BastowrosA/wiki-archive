h2. Building on Windows

There are two ways of building Node. One is over the Cygwin emulation layer the other is using MinGW (GNU toolchain for windows). See the "Cygwin":https://github.com/ry/node/wiki/Building-node.js-on-Cygwin-%28Windows%29 and "MinGW":https://github.com/ry/node/wiki/Building-node.js-on-mingw pages.

Neither builds are satisfactorily stable but it is possible to get something running.
